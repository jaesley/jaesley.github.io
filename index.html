	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>
		The first concert I ever saw was The Eagles, on their Hell Freezes Over reunion tour. I'm pretty sure I was the only six-year-old in the arena, and definitely the only six-year-old that afterward insisted on naming her new puppy "Eagles."
	</p>

	<p>	
		But ever since then, I've loved live music and now that I live in Seattle, where basically every act plays at some point, I go to shows all the time, at venues of all sizes all over town. And everywhere I go, I always take photos of the bands. So here I've catalogued a few of my favorite concert experiences for you.

		Going to see one of my favorite musicians, <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>, turned out to be an all-day adventure. We had to get wristbands early in the day with our GA tickets; then, in the afternoon, we had to line up according to those numbers. They then drew a number, and the first few hundred people in line behind that number got to go in first, and get the best front-row seats. I was near the front of the secondary group of GA admissions, so I still got to see Bruce close up when he came through the crowd. This is right after he held my hand and we sang "Hungry Heart" at each other.

		I first saw <strong>Glass Animals</strong> at Summer Camp 2015, and managed to snag a set list for my memorabilia wall. I got to see them on their own last year, with local boy Manatee Commune opening. At one point, they brought out a pineapple, and threw it into the audience after singing at it for a minute. Unfortunately, I didn't come away with that souvenir. But then, I also don't like pineapple, so maybe that's for the best.

	<h3>Terrible Dancing</h3>

	<section class="artist">

		</figure>

		<strong>La Femme</strong> is a French psych-punk outfit who performed while wearing Halloween costumes, including this onesie + tiara combo. My photo is terrible because it was a non-stop dance party. Also I don't speak French.

		<strong>Twenty-One Pilots</strong> put on an amazing show at Deck the Hall Ball 2015. At one point, the drummer was on a platform being held up by the crowd while he drummed on top of us, right next to me. And the crowd was absolutely nuts.

		Me <em>(center)</em> with the lead singers of <strong>July Talk</strong>. These guys have an amazing energy on stage, and Peter's voice sounds like Tom Waits swallowed sandpaper.

		<strong>Nick Cave</strong> puts on the best live show I've seen yet. It was so intense the whole way through.

		Not only does <strong>In the Valley Below</strong> put on a great show, and impress me with their ability to play and sing together, they were the first artist to repost one of my photos on their Twitter and Instagram pages.

			<figcaption>Sons of an Illustrious Father</figcaption>
		</figure>

		I love falling in love with extraordinary opening acts, and <strong>Sons of an Illustrious Father</strong> is one of them. Also, if the drummer looks familiar, that's because he's one of the main characters from <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. I only found this out hours later, after I'd talked to the band post-show--they're super nice and down to earth!

			<figcaption>Kaleo</figcaption>
		</figure>

		I first saw <strong>Kaleo</strong> open for Vance Joy at the Showbox in Seattle, and they caught my eye immediately. They just sold out two headlining shows at the Showbox this week (I was there of course) and I love that they're seeing huge success now. ... But I still loved them before they were cool. ;)

	<h2>Other People's Work</h2>

	<p>
		I love following other people's concert photography on Instagram, whether it's through a band's insta or through an individual photography. If I see someone's work that I like, I'll often investigate them further. One of the people whose photos I love is Katrina Barber. She has an instagram and also <a href="katrinabarberphotos.com">a website</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, I find Katrina's website to be a little lackluster, especially when she has such strong images to showcase. My first thought was that it was probably a WordPress site; the source code shows it's actually via SquareSpace. So it's easy to guess why it might feel more generic than something commissioned specifically for the owner. Also, the image galleries, like this one of <a href="http://katrinabarberphotos.com/shaky-knees-2016/">Shaky Knees Festival 2016</a>, feature just rows of images with a simple caption, all done via very plain <code>div</code> tags. I feel like there should be a way to code a more image-friendly layout, that really showcases the photos. As is, the layout feels really simple--the end look isn't so different from what I've done above, and I don't think my html work is that stellar (yet).
