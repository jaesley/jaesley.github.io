<h1>It's time for a show!</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
	The first concert I ever saw was The Eagles, on their Hell Freezes Over reunion tour. I'm pretty sure I was the only six-year-old in the arena, and definitely the only six-year-old that ever insisted on naming her new puppy "Eagles."
</p>

<p>
	But ever since then, I've loved live music and now that I live in Seattle, where basically every act plays at some point, I go to shows all the time, at venues of all sizes all over town. And everywhere I go, I always take photos of the bands. So here I've catalogued a few of my favorite concert experiences for you.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Top Five Shows</strong> <em>(subject to change depending on whim)</em>
</p>

<ol reversed>
	<li>Emily Wells (Barboza, Seattle WA, 03/12/17).</li>
	<li>The Last Internationale (The Crocodile, Seattle WA, 05/21/16). </li>
	<li>July Talk (Sunset Tavern, Seattle WA, 01/24/17).</li>
	<li>The National (The National, Richmond VA, 04/23/10). I drove eight hours to see this show. Worth it.</li>
	<li>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (Paramount Theatre, Seattle WA, 07/02/14). Hands down the most amazing show I've ever seen.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<strong>Reasons I Love Concerts</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Good music!</li>
	<li>Terrible dancing is socially acceptable</li>
	<li>You meet cool people and sometimes your idols</li>
	<li>Hipster cred, activate!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Good Music</h3>

<p>
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/brucespringsteen.jpg" height="400" alt="Bruce Springsteen" /> One of my favorite musicians, <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>. This is right after he held my hand and we sang "Hungry Heart" at each other.
	<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/glassanimals.jpg" height="400" alt="Glass Animals" /> <strong>Glass Animals</strong> at the Paramount Theatre. This is right after they brought the pineapple out on stage.
</p>

<h3>Terrible Dancing</h3>

<p>
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/lafemme.jpg" height="400" alt="La Femme" /> <strong>La Femme</strong> is a French psych-punk outfit who performed while wearing Halloween costumes, including this onesie + tiara combo. My photo is terrible because it was a non-stop dance party. Also I don't speak French.
	<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/twentyonepilots.jpg" height="400" alt="Twenty-One Pilots" /> <strong>Twenty-One Pilots</strong> put on an amazing show at Deck the Hall Ball 2015. At one point, the drummer was on a platform being held up by the crowd while he drummed on top of us, right next to me. And the crowd was absolutely nuts.
</p>

<h3>Cool People</h3>
<p>
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/julytalk.jpg" height="400" alt="July Talk" /> Me <em>(center)</em> with the lead singers of <strong>July Talk</strong>. These guys have an amazing energy on stage, and Peter's voice sounds like Tom Waits swallowed sandpaper.
	<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/nickcave.jpg" height="400" alt="Nick Cave" /> <strong>Nick Cave</strong> puts on the best live show I've seen yet. It was so intense the whole way through.
</p>

<h3>Hipster Cred</h3>

<p>
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/inthevalleybelow.jpg" height="400" alt="In the Valley Below" /> Not only does <strong>In the Valley Below</strong> put on a great show, and impress me with their ability to play and sing together, they were the first artist to repost one of my photos on their Twitter and Instagram pages.
	<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/sonsofanillustriousfather.jpg" height="400" alt="Sons of An Illustrious Father" />I love falling in love with extraordinary opening acts, and <strong>Sons of an Illustrious Father</strong> is one of them. Also, if the drummer looks familiar, that's because he's one of the main characters from <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. I only found this out hours later, after I'd talked to the band post-show--they're super nice and down to earth!
	<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaesley/jaesley.github.io/indexbranch/kaleo.jpg" height="400" alt="Kaleo" /> I first saw <strong>Kaleo</strong> open for Vance Joy at the Showbox in Seattle, and they caught my eye immediately. They just sold out two headlining shows at the Showbox this week (I was there of course) and I love that they're seeing huge success now. ... But I still loved them before they were cool. ;)
