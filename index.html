<h1>It's time for a show!</h1>

<p>
	The first concert I ever saw was The Eagles, on their Hell Freezes Over reunion tour. I'm pretty sure I was the only six-year-old in the arena, and definitely the only six-year-old that ever insisted on naming her new puppy "Eagles."
</p>

<p>
	But ever since then, I've loved live music and now that I live in Seattle, where basically every act plays at some point, I go to shows all the time, at venues of all sizes all over town. And everywhere I go, I always take photos of the bands. So here I've catalogued a few of my favorite concert experiences for you.
</p>

<p>
	Top Five Shows (subject to change depending on whim)
</p>

<ol reversed>
	<li>Emily Wells (Barboza, Seattle WA, 03/12/17).
	<li>The Last Internationale (The Crocodile, Seattle WA, 05/21/16). </li>
	<li>July Talk (Sunset Tavern, Seattle Wa, 01/24/17).
	<li>The National (The National, Richmond VA, 04/23/10). I drove eight hours to see this show. Worth it.</li>
	<li>NicK Cave and the Bad Seeds (Paramount Theatre, Seattle WA, 07/02/14). Hands down the most amazing show I've ever seen.</li>
</ol>

<p>
